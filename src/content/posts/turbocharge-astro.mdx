## Introduction

Yeah, I know, I know. I'm a bit late to the party. But since I've used Astro now, there's nothing wrong with me
sharing some of my experiences with it. I've been using Astro for a few months now, and I've been loving it. It's
a great tool for building a SSR site (or even static ones, to be fair), and it's super fast. But I've been wondering
if it could be even faster.

## What is Hotwire's Turbo?

So, what is Turbo? Turbo is a set of tools that bundles several techniques for creating fast, modern,
progressively enhanced web applications without using much JavaScript. It offers a simpler alternative to the prevailing
client-side frameworks which put all the logic in the front-end and confine the server side of your app to being little
more than a JSON API. (Source: [Hotwire's Turbo Handbook](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction))

It uses Hotwire, short for HTML-over-the-wire, it's (not really) a new method of doing web development. But whatever
kicks my bucket, I guess. You can watch this video to get a better idea of what Hotwire is:

## Enough talk, let's get to the point

So, how can we use Turbo with Astro? Well, it's actually pretty simple. But first, let's install the package first.

The package name is `@hotwired/turbo`. I'm using `pnpm` in this post but you can use `npm` or `yarn` if you want.

```bash
pnpm add @hotwired/turbo
```

Now, let's make a script that will load the Turbo library. I'm going to make a `scripts` folder in the root of my
project, and then make a `router.js` file in it. This is what it looks like:

```js
import * as Turbo from "@hotwired/turbo";

Turbo.start();
```

Now, let's import this script in our root layout file. Well, just put it in the head tag. Here's what it looks like in my root layout file:

```astro
---
import Footer from "../components/solidjs/Footer";
import NavRail from "../components/solidjs/NavRail";
import "../styles/globals.css";

const { title, description } = Astro.props;
const { pathname } = Astro.url;
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- ... meta and other stuffs ... -->
    <script>
      import "../scripts/router.js";
    </script>
  </head>
  <body
    class="bg-neutral-900 w-full h-screen flex flex-col md:flex-row overflow-hidden"
  >
    <!-- ... body stuffs ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

And yeah, that's it. Enjoy your SPA-like experience with Astro. I'm not going to go into detail about how to use Turbo
in probably some more advanced ways (yes, it does have some interesting features like Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams),
but you can check out the [Turbo Handbook](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction) to learn more about it.

## So, what's the catch?

Well, I don't think there's a catch. So, yeah, that's it. I hope you enjoyed this post. If you have any questions,
feel free to ask them in the comments below.
