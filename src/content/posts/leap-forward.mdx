```
The past has passed. The present amends. The future will nurture.
Stubbornness teaches. Downfall cultivates. Loss develops.
Experience improves. Connection helps. Logic advises.
Love hates. Hate loves. Ignorance nulls.

For where I stand is chaotic. For who I stand is eccentric.
For what I stand is intrinsic. For how I stand is pyrrhic.
Long been I asking why. Long been I wondering why.
Realized, I am. Under blankets of reality.

In which no means something and yes means nothing.
```
