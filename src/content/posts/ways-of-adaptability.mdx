## Introduction

My name is Irvan Malik Azantha and I'm from Universitas Sriwijaya. I currently run on Bangkit Academy as a Cloud Computing Cohort. Without further ado, let's just cut into the topic.

As I embarked on my journey with the Bangkit 2023 program, I realized that adaptability is key to thrive in this dynamic learning environment. Throughout the program, I have employed various ways of adaptability to navigate challenges and make the most out of my experience.

## Interacting

Interacting with fellow cohorts, experienced friends and colleagues, and mentor has been a crucial aspect of my Bangkit 2023 experience. I adapted my ways of interacting by actively engaging in online discussions, actively listening to diverse perspectives, and expressing my ideas clearly and respectfully.

## Achieving

Achieving my goals and targets required adaptability in my approach. I learned to set realistic goals, break them down into smaller manageable tasks, and adapt my strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances. I embraced a growth mindset, viewing failures as opportunities to learn and improve.

## Learning

Learning was a core component of my Bangkit 2023 experience, and I approached it with adaptability. I acknowledged that learning is a continuous process and that I needed to adapt my learning strategies to suit the demands of the program (especially the extraordinary schedules Bangkit gave me). I was open to feedback and incorporated it into my learning process, utilized a mix of resources including online materials, peer discussions, and mentor guidance to expand my knowledge and skills.

## Working

Adapting my approach to work was a critical aspect of my Bangkit 2023 experience. As the program involved individual assignments and self-directed learning (Capstone is coming tho, the storm is brewing), I had to adapt my working style to meet the unique demands of the program. I learned to manage my time at least as effective as I can, being more aggressively task-oriented - you won't have deadline problems if you don't even have a deadline in the first place - and creating a schedule to ensure that I at least stayed on track. I also practiced self-motivation and discipline, pushing myself to stay focused and productive even when working independently.

## Thinking

Adapting my way of thinking was essential to overcome challenges and find innovative solutions. I cultivated a positive and resilient mindset, viewing challenges as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles. I practiced critical thinking, analyzing problems from different perspectives, and adapting my problem-solving approaches based on the situation. I also embraced creativity and innovation, exploring new ideas and perspectives, and challenging traditional ways of thinking to come up with novel solutions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Bangkit 2023 program has been a transformative journey that has required me to adapt in various ways. Through effective interaction, goal-oriented achievement, continuous learning, effective and task-oriented work, and adaptable thinking, I have been able to make the most out of my experience, build valuable skills, and foster meaningful connections. These 5 ways of adaptability have not only been instrumental in my Bangkit 2023 journey but have also equipped me with valuable life skills that I can apply in any future endeavor.
