## Song Description

“アイドル (Idol)” is a song by Japanese duo YOASOBI as the opening for the anime 推しの子 (Oshi no Ko). Although driven by “bright and poppy” sound, this song describes the troubles and harsh rules an idol faces in the Japan entertainment industry, and the issues between idealistic expectations of an idol compared to their flawed reality.

According to YOASOBI, the song stayed faithful to the original manga and a specially written story titled 45510, with lines intertwined with the plot of both accounts from B-Komachi's former members, Ai Hoshino herself and a third person point of view.

Since its release, “Idol” has achieved commercial success, surpassing 100 million streams, and has been on a no.1 consecutive week streak on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. It is also the second most streamed song in a single week in Japan, behind BTS‘ “Butter.”

## Lyrics

```
Couldn't beat her smile, it stirred up all the media
Secret side, I wanna know it
So mysterious

Even that elusive side, part of her controlled area
Complete and perfect
All you say is a bunch of lies

Dear miss genius idol, unmatched

What did you eat today?
What book do you love?
Whenever you go out for fun, tell me, where do you go?
Haven't eaten anything
It's a secret, unknown
Any questions you're facing, always acting so vaguely

So unconcerned, although you brightly glow
Any seemingly unveiled secrets are as sweet as honey
Confusing, why, why, why?
Essential lie, lie, lie
So, what is your type of guy?
Any partner?
So, now, answer this

“I don't have any idea how I could love anyone”
“I don't seem to know what it signifies”
Cannot find out if it's true or it's a lie
Once again, there's somebody who's fallen for the words and cues
Made him lose his head over you

That emotion melts all hearts, all eyes on you
Cause you are perfect, the most ultimate idol
Unrivaled, will not appear again
It's the brightest star reborn, yes, indeed
Using that smiling face
That “I love you” again

Now, everybody is lured and captivated by you
The pupil that you got
The words you vocalize
Even when untrue, it's your perfected Ai

Right, right, we all know she's very special, yes
We had lost the fight before it started, so impressed
Miss I'm such a star
We're serving as support to her grace
Cannot tell me everything was because of her
No, it's not right
Out of line

How can we not feel jealous while being around
It's not a joke, you know, right?
So, I cannot forgive you for that
Completely deny
Imperfect you that I sight
Myself, no pardon allowed
I won't allow anyone if it's not you, strongest of all

That emotion seized all hearts worshiping you
Yes, indeed
So strong, it's you, unrivaled idol
There cannot be weaknesses to find
The brightest star is residing in you
The gaps and shortcomings, don't show'em
Dammit, dammit

Parts nobody wants to know should remain hidden
One and only
If it's different, no way, no way
Such a true love, it's the realest Ai

Showing this smile, my own weapon
Boiling media
Keeping everything about my secret deep inside
“I'm in love with you,” my career is built on such a lie
It's the way I know to show my love, without a doubt
Running down, my sweat is flowing
Cleanest aqua, right?

Ruby hidden under my eyelids where it resides
I sing and dance around
Look at me, I'm Maria
So, lying surely is the greatest kind of love

I recall no one that loved me whole before
And I've not been in love with anybody before
Now, the lies I'm making up
I'm hoping that a day comes when they all become true
And I keep wishing they do

One day, I will hold everything that I pursue
Yes, I am so greedy, true voracious idol
So, sincerely, what I'm wishing for is to
love each of you with all my heart
And so, today, I lie again

The words I vocalize inside of me
I'm wishing that one day they come true
Up to this day, I've not been able to let you
And you hear me saying those meaningful words
I said it at last
I know it's not a lie as I'm voicing these words
I love you
```
