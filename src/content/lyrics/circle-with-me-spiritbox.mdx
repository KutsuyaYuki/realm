## Song Description

“Circle With Me” is the lead single off Spiritbox's debut full-length album, Eternal Blue. As lead vocalist Courtney LaPlante explained in a Loudwire press release, the track and its darker songwriting, reflect a deeply personal “spectrum” of her emotions.

In this sense, “Circle With Me” may be taken as a self-invitation to claim newfound confidence in the face of emotional doubt and suffering. Unsteadiness claims the song's narrator, who contemplates figurative martyrdom to rid themselves of their insecurities, to cleanse themselves in a paradoxically revitalizing “flames.” Plagued by uncertainty, however, they, and their contradictory thoughts, continue in an infinite cycle, mirrored by the spinning cinematography on the song's music video.

A song of contrasts, the track features Courtney's soaring clean vocals against a hammering bassline. On the bridge, Courtney's visceral screams are backed by a full breakdown, bringing the track to a chilling close.

## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours
Cut down the altar

[Verse 1]
Visionaire and deepest fake
Dirty gold, the colours change
Hands are frozen, feel no pain
I just wanna hold the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I wanna know
If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"

[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

[Verse 2]
Nothing sacred, nothing lost
When birds of prey invade my thoughts
They promise I will feel the pain
Not strong enough to hold the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I wanna know
If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"

[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

[Bridge]
I held the power of a dying sun
I climb the altar and I claim my place as God
Circle with me
Circle with me
This could all be yours

[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame

[Post-Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
A traitor watching me as
Birds of prey never falter
This could all be yours
This could all be yours

[Outro]
Circle with me
```
