## Prologue

After months of using my trusty KZ EDA, I started to crave a change. The KZ's tuning had grown stale, and the hassle of retuning it was becoming frustrating. So, I decided it was time to dive into the world of new in-ear monitors (IEMs). As the title suggests, I opted for the Moondrop Chu II.

## Unboxing

Moondrop has pulled out all the stops with the Chu II's packaging. Inside the box, you'll find the IEMs themselves, a set of decent but not exceptional ear tips (sadly, no Spring Tips this time), a convenient pouch for storing the IEMs, the cable, a warranty card, and some anime-themed extras I won't delve into.

## Build Quality

The Chu II boasts a sturdy all-metal housing with a replaceable brass nozzle. Moondrop has a penchant for metallic finishes, which gives their products a premium look and feel, but it does come with a drawback - moisture can be a concern.

Now, let's talk about the ear tips provided. They skipped their usual Spring Tips, and while the stock ear tips are serviceable, they aren't anything to write home about. Choosing the right size for your ears is crucial for comfort and sound quality. Personally, I ended up purchasing M-size Spring Tips to enhance my listening experience.

The included cable is a single-stranded, silver-plated copper cable in a silver color, sans a microphone. The cables do the job, but their thinness raises concerns about long-term durability. To address this, I swapped them out for the JCAlly JC16S cable, which not only offers better durability but also includes a microphone and is notably thicker.

After a month of use, I noticed some discoloration on the brass nozzle. While it doesn't affect performance, it's an aesthetic concern. Additionally, moisture buildup can be an issue, so I invested in a 3-in-1 cleaner for occasional maintenance and now carry silica gel packs to keep the case dry - a bit of "caseception," if you will. I also purchased a replacement filter, although it's worth noting that it's slightly smaller in diameter than the Chu II's filter. Nevertheless, replacing it is a breeze, so why not have a spare on hand?

## Sound Quality

In terms of sound quality, the Chu II reigns supreme in its budget category. It retains the classic Chu characteristics but with a twist: slightly reduced treble and more pronounced bass, giving it a leaning towards a V-shaped sound signature (consistent with Moondrop's in-house VSDF). Of course, whether this sounds "natural" or not is subjective.

### Bass

The bass is detailed and well-suited for its price range. It doesn't overwhelm with booming bass but instead offers a fun and well-pronounced mid-bass along with nuanced sub-bass, adding depth and richness to the listening experience.

### Mids

The midrange is where the Chu II shines with excellent detail and clarity, albeit slightly recessed. Vocals sound heavenly and immersive, while instruments exhibit enjoyable texture and a lively feel.

### Treble

Treble is a delight with its enjoyable, non-fatiguing character. Cymbals sound realistic, and the overall energetic vibe it imparts is above average. Remarkable, especially considering the IEM's price point.

### Soundstage

The Moondrop Chu II boasts a remarkable soundstage that is expansive and immersive, a standout feature in its price category. When you put on these IEMs, you're immediately enveloped in a wide and meticulously crafted auditory space.

### Imaging

The Chu II inherits the impressive imaging prowess of its predecessor. It delivers pinpoint accuracy and precision for those who value such qualities in their audio experience.

## Verdict

The Moondrop Chu II represents a compelling choice for audiophiles seeking budget-friendly IEMs with impressive sound quality. While there are minor concerns like cable durability and moisture buildup, the overall package, including the build quality and audio performance, makes the Chu II a worthy addition to your audio arsenal. Whether you're diving into the world of high-quality audio for the first time or seeking an upgrade, the Chu II won't disappoint. Just be ready to invest in some additional accessories like ear tips and perhaps a sturdier cable for the best experience.
