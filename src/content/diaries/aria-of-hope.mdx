## The Aria

What a song to be heard. The smiling face of the valiant person I am. Rest upon the tree I was.
Let them heard the message. Let it spread to the world. The truth has been told.
Hear o' hear The Aria of Hope. In which the light shines upon. In which the dark sets.

## The Point of Normalizing This Section

Okay, so enough poetry. So I made this section to tell some stories about myself in a (hopefully)
daily basis. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it, but I'll try my best. I'll try to make it as
interesting as possible. If you define interesting as boring anyways. Probably make a book about this.

Not gonna lie, this gives me a bit of chill. Writing was and is always my hobby. I've been writing
since I was 5. Poems, stories, songs, raps, you name it.

Oh, and don't forget some pesky codes. I don't hate coding, I just don't like how it sometimes mess
my brain up.

So yeah, have fun reading this if you even actually read this section.
