## Why can't I just sleep?

Really, it has been bothering me since like half a year ago that my entire
sleeping schedule is just messed up. I can't sleep at night, and I can't
seem to wake up in the morning. I have tried to fix it, but it just doesn't
work like, at all. I've tried literally EVERYTHING.

When I mean EVERYTHING, here's a list of things I've tried:

### Trying to sleep early at night

Rationale: If I try to sleep early, I might actually be able to sleep.

Result: I can't sleep at all.

### Trying the first method again but without devices

Rationale: I might be able to sleep if I don't use my phone or laptop.

Result: I still can't sleep at all.

### Thrown the first 2 methods and try to sleep after Subuh prayer

Rationale: Subuh prayer is at approximately 04:45 AM, so I might be able to sleep after exhausting myself by helping
to prepare for Sahur (pre-dawn meal), cleaning up the entire thing after, then praying Subuh.

Result: I still can't sleep at all because my brain suddenly decides to remember that
sleeping after Subuh is a bad idea.

### Trying to sleep at morning

Rationale: I might be able to sleep if I try to sleep at the morning.

Result: I still can't sleep at all. No, seriously, I still can't sleep at all.

### Trying to sleep at noon

Rationale: I might be able to sleep if I try to sleep at noon.

Result: I still can't sleep at all. God, please help me.

### Trying to sleep at afternoon

Rationale: I might be able to sleep if I try to sleep at afternoon.

Result: I still can't sleep at all. I'm starting to think that I'm cursed.

### Trying to sleep after Maghrib prayer

Rationale: Maghrib prayer is at approximately 06:10 PM, so I might be able to sleep after exhausting myself by helping
to prepare for Iftar (fast-breaking evening meal), cleaning up the entire thing after, then praying Maghrib. The food
I consume during Iftar is usually heavy, so I might be able to sleep after that.

Result: I still can't sleep at all. Yeah, I'm probably cursed.

### Trying to not sleep

Rationale: I might be able to sleep if I don't try to sleep at all.

Result: I slept.

## Ending Note

Yeah, you really are cursed with stupid events like this. I'm sorry, but I
can't help you with this, me. I'm just as confused as you are.
