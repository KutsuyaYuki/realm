## Legacy of the Black Poet

> Why? Why must I? I've given you what you've always wanted!

He's a person of the past, but his legacy lives on. He was a poet, a visionary, a leader, a great pretender.
He changed the life of a puny savage into a great story. Mischievous as he was, I still admire his accomplishments.
But what was it all for? What was the point of it all? I don't know. I don't know what he was trying to achieve.
He's trying to say something, in which I don't know what is. He's trying to prove something. But what is it he's trying to prove?

His mind was corrupted with the sense of power. A force that he can't control. Manipulative, a liar he was.
The only thing he was good at was to deceive. To make something look great, as if it was.
The demon that walked the earth, the one that was the cause of all the chaos. The one that was the cause of all the pain.

> I've given you the power you want, the sights of a better future!

He pursued me into hiding and I was forced to run. I was forced to run away from my home, from my family, from my friends.
I was forced to push everyone away. Everyone I loved. Everyone I cared about. Everyone I knew. Everyone I trusted.
He chained me to the past he forced me to believe in. And by it I lived. The memories of the past, the memories of hatred.

> NO! I don't want this! You are me and I am you! I am the Black Poet! I'm the one in charge!

He was the one responsible for my fake achievements and accomplishments. He was the one responsible for my fake life.
Each and every bit of dark magic he used to make me look great. It was worth for a while, but it was all a lie.

## Dictat Delenda Est

> NO! What are you doing? STOP!

The struggle of pain and suffering. The point of total breakdown. I thought this is the end of me. The rise of a point
in which there's no return or any way back. Hope is lost. The only thing left is to give up. To give up on everything.

But then I realized. This is not the end. I realized the world is not as bad as it seems. I realized that there's still hope.
The hope awaited for me. It awaited for me to break the chains I was bound to. The past that I don't need to carry.

I realized that I can change. I realized that I can be better. I realized that I can be great. I realized that I can be free.

He, the slave of the past, the construct of pain and suffering, and the demon that reside in the darkness of my mind.
He who once controlled me, the pressure that once held me down, the chains that once bound me. He is no more.

> NO! Don-

I reign over me. You won't stop me.

## O' Black Poet, Rest in Your Eternal Sleep

Finally freed, I can finally move on. Freedom of the mind, the apple of my eye. The one that I've been searching for.
Shall you sleep in peace, O' Black Poet. You've done your job. You've done your part. You've done your duty.
You've proven your achievements. You've had a great ride. The stories you leave behind will be remembered.

The colors of black will unfold to reveal a new dawn. The light which shines upon me, the light which shines upon us.

## A New Beginning

The past is gone. The future is yet to come. The present is here. The present is now. The present is the only thing that matters.
It is time to prove that I am the better me. I will be better. I have found the map of hope. The path to which I will walk.

I will change what I must. And I will do it whatever it takes.
