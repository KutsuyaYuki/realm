## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
100graham

[Chorus: Connor Price]
Woo! Feelin' so tall I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Woah, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus
Yeah, blue faces blowin' up like Violet

[Verse 1: Connor Price]
Talk about the things they gonna say when they see me
And when they see me they just dap me up and say good to meet me
I keep it goin', flowin' over this, I make it look easy
Easy for me to say I do this every day of the week
I'm eager to be the one they talk about when all said and done with it
I'm the feature that they want, but then they don't when I come with it
I'm a scene-stealer, seat-filler, blow up the numbers
And I ain't leavin' no crumbs, so you know when I'm done with it
I'm a new school vibe with an old soul
Oh, so great, stay paid by the boat load
Don't go chasin' the wave, I'm a row boat
Blow smoke right through the face of the ozone, oh no
I got the bag, I'm back to just double it
I'm 'bout to pop the top, I been bubblin'
They want the spot, but I do not cut 'em in
They tryna plot my drop, they been huddlin'
[Chorus: Connor Price & Killa]
Ah, feelin' so tall I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Woah, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus (Killa)
Yeah, blue faces blowin' up like Violet (Yo)

[Verse 2: Killa]
I know a lot of people prayin' for my downfall
But the only thing that I'll be down for is bein' top five, but like down four
I'm down to earth like the ground floor
But I've been fly so long, I tend to ask people, "What's the ground for?"
Man, I'm only headed up
See, my flow volcanic, this the fire I erupt
Heard the fans gettin' rowdy 'cause they haven't had enough
You know I'm runnin' the city, you just running out of luck
Huh, yeah, I said it with my chest
I flow hard, it's no wonder that they easily impressed
I'm so far, but I'm always comin' back with somethin' fresh
I never rest, swear you'll never catch this eagle in a nest
I invest my time in the booth I find
The peace I use to piece the boom in my mind
My ex knows this, let me expose this
She left 'cause she don't wanna be with an explosive
Man, I'm just

[Chorus: Connor Price]
Feelin' so tall I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Woah, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus
Yeah, blue faces blowin' up like Violet
