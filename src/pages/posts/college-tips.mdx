## Abstract

Being a college student is kinda tough nowadays. Especially when that damn random sore throat virus disease came and wrecked everything around. So, a few while back (not really a few while back, it's more like a year or two), I noticed some students, including my peers and mates, having a hard regression on their grades because of online classes. They told me they weren't used to this type of learning and it made them confused and distressed. Well, no one can put a blame on that, people are different after all. But now that I've talked about it, I might as well give you all a couple tips especially for you residing in Indonesian colleges to **not get fucked up**. So stay, and read 'til the end cause it'll give you insights on how to do it.

## Quickstart

Well, for starters, try to read this quickstart to its fullest. This quickstart is entirely pointless but also, at the same time, serves you a point for **not being a fuckwit towards reading material or any learning material ever**. This quickstart section is dedicated entirely to test your focus and your willingness to not skip even the tiniest details possible, even if it is essentially pointless to even care for it. Don't try to even move your eyes away from reading this or you'll simply fail the test of time, focus, and patience. Believe me, this is worth your time. In the depths of Zoom and/or Google Meetings (or even Skype meetings, if you prefer), this little soft skill of caring for everything _even for the tiniest detail_ gives you alot of advantages in this current situation of online/hybrid college course meetings. Do remind yourself to not be too focused you simply forget anything that exists around you.

## The Etiquettes of Asking

Asking is one of our natural way to simply know and/or learn something. Asking sometimes is needed at times when you actually out of mindpower to think of a solution to a problem or when you simply don't know what the actual fuck you're dealing with (usually **programmers** and almost all types of **engineers** do). In this online/hybrid learning era, you'll probably ask more to online forums and/or friends than your lecturers for stuffs you don't know. Lucky you cause I compiled a list of rules for the etiquettes of asking online (or even offline, to be fair).

### Don't Ask to Ask

Yes, as the name said. **Don't ask to ask**. Let's say, there's a person in a forum that doesn't understand how Y work. Let's call her Liz. She then asks in the forum,

```
Liz: Hello, does anybody know anything about Y?
```

May god forgive me but that person right there asking that is a _legally approved **cunt**_. Wonder why? Let me rephrase it into something she actually wants to ask,

```
Liz: Hello, does anybody know anything about Y who are willing to look into my problem with
     the highest commitment, whatever it is, even if it's not actually related to Y or
     if someone else could simply answer my question, even if they don't know Y or the
     subject that I'm going to ask?
```

Yes, that sounds right. And there are reasons why people that actually understand Y don't want to answer it. Let me take a bit of quote from https://dontasktoask.com (check it out, also a great source to read):

> By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking. You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other people out.

And alternatively, that question can be seen as,

```
Liz: Hello, I have a question about Y but I'm too lazy to actually say what I actually
     want to ask so can someone formulate the question and answer it for me?
```

which is just lazy and deranged. No solution for those who doesn't even want to at least work it out.

The solution for this is simply **don't ask to ask, just ask**. Yes, it's that simple. People who swipe up and down the forum chat/thread would probably ignore your question if it is like the aforementioned examples. People might get some interest if you actually ask the real thing and actually answer it for you. If you want a proper example,

```
Liz: Hello, I am having problems on [the problem] with Y equation, is there
     any solution to this or a reference that I can read?
```

like that. Yes that's better.

### No Hello

Yes, and I mean it. Don't say hello if you want to ask in a technical forum. It's just a waste of time. Say there's a person named "Person A" and another person that is a professional at that field Person A wants to ask, say "Person B". Here's how it went if Person A said hello first,

```
Person A: Hi                                                                [09:48]
Person B: ...?                                                              [09:48]
Person A: Can you please solve this bla bla bla, I have done bla bla bla    [09:59]
          and yield no result.
Person B: Oh, it's to bla bla bla.                                          [10:00]
```

like bro, you could literally save bunch of time just directly asking the actual question like what the fuck? Also, here's a long list of stuffs that equates as "Hello" for noobs and starters:

```
"Hello, anybody around?"
"Hi, bro, quick question?"
"Anybody free?"
"Anybody up?"
"P" (yes, literally, just fucking get to the point you Indonesian fucks)
"Ping" (another version)
"Hey"
"Hi"
"Howdy mate?"
"Hello chat" (this one is acceptable in a shitpost group)
"Hi everyone"
"Can I ask a few questions?" (also don't ask to ask but nevermind)
and more...
```

If you really feel not to comfy to not say hi, you can just simply put it before you ask. For example, you can do this:

```
Person A: Hi, can you please solve this bla bla bla, I have done bla bla bla  [09:48]
          and yield no result.
Person B: Oh, it's bla bla bla                                                [09:49]
```

Oh that would be really awesome I would fucking agree with that. Also here's some more examples:

```
"Howdy? Is there any solution to my problem? I have been [what you doing]"
"Hey, can somebody help me solve my problem? I want to [what you want to do] and [what have you done]"
"If you guys aren't busy, can you take a look at my issue? I currently am doing [what you do and your problem]"
and more...
```

It just makes total sense and not waste time for real. Be like that and you get an appreciation from me.

## The Importance of Friend Circles

Oh boy, this is **really important**. I've heard enough college students having no friend just because they thought _friends at highschool are way cooler_. Yes, it is true to some degree but have you ever wondered how the term "friends" actually work in college? Yes, you need **circles** of people with the same interest and same frequency as you. No matter how you like it or not, it would simply be that way. College aren't highschool and we have to admit it. Accept the fate. Here's a list of things you would probably get from having a circle (read this you fucking weebs and hardline college NEETs):

1. Someone to actually talk and share things to.
2. Someone to actually ask for assignment copy.
3. Someone to ask for help.
4. Someone to hang out.
5. Someone to share interests and stuff.
6. Someone to sleep with. (go get some bitches)
7. Someone to walk through the college hell courses.
8. And more to say.

Imagine you showcasing your final project but no single head come to see you aside from (probably, if they can come anyways) your family. That would be mentally taxing and awful for your wellbeing. _But I've been used to this_ yo shut the fuck up. You are a human, motherfucker. You **NEED** to socialize. Either you an introvert, ambivert, extrovert, or a fucking retard, or a retarded combination of all, there is no reason to not fucking socialize.

Also it's a plus if you actually got a lecturer on your side which I'll also mention in the next section.

## Befriend The Lecturer

Yes and I mean it. There are advantages for befriending your lecturer. I won't barge into all of it so I will explain it in one section, as detailed as I can.

1. First of all, you have all the might and power to completely be confident that you will get a straight A on that study. You're befriending a lecturer. What do you expect?
2. Second of all, you probably will be respected by your peer comrades once you get to the point of **negotiating with the lecturer** since your acceptance point is high enough to be able to monopolize the decisions made.
3. Last of all (probably), you can simply ask questions with far more ease and less tension than if you not befriending that lecturer. You can even make informal jokes once the situation allows you to. This may bring their opinion towards or against you do, provided the condition.

There's also some catch from doing exactly that. I'll describe some for noobs and starters:

1. You probably get manipulated frequently considering your lecturer acceptance points towards you (for real).
2. You might get some hard stuff to do since they will definitely ask for help (yes, that's how it might go).
3. People tend to regard you as a bootlicker for being close to the lecturer. Kindly ignore them. The best solution ever.
4. And more, actually.

It's a radically more double edged approach but if you manage to do it good, oh boy, the benefits are surreal.

## Don't Make Enemies, Make Unity

I'll divide this into two topics. One that explains why you shouldn't make enemies, and one that explains why you should unite the pack. Let's start with the first one, not making enemies.

### Don't Make Enemies

It might seem cool if you're the only **alpha** of the pack but no. You will absolutely get no benefit for being a dick. Being a dick just literally means that **you will be the most hated guy in the entire campus** for real. People will puke at your face for that. They will happily not befriend you and make you an enemy, too! That's probably not news since you're making enemies. Instead, if you can, but don't do it tho, "befriend" your peer that you don't like if they have any use. That would make it better for you and your wellbeing. Nothing to lose beside your ego anyways, and you need to lose it anyways.

### Make Unity

Have you ever heard this term being coined before?

> Apes together strong!

Yes, the more people unites, the stronger you people become. One person is bad. Many person supporting the same decisions are good. In fact, they're really good you should probably make it a tagline for every class you're in. Make a group learning, make a group hanging out, unite as many people as you can and you got plenty of support. Circles? yeah this also apply those rules I mentioned earlier but in a far bigger scale. Imagine if your peers are inline with your thoughts and ideals (assuming you're an idealist). That would be really, really awesome.

## Don't Follow The Curriculum

No, fucking leave it if you think the curriculum you're using now is a god given right to learn only in college. Use your curriculum as a guideline of where should you go after. The entire purpose of a curriculum is to guide your path of learning, to not make your way a disarray. It's not 1990s, guys, we have fucking Google, YouTube, Medium, sites that provides thesis/final report/final project or anything really. You can search for everything in internet. You could probably get your data somewhere on the internet in an obscure site. It's a place with millions of possibilities! Use it to your advantage and learn from it. There's many information and subsequently, knowledge if you do it right. Leave TikTok by the way. Shit's fucked up. And that is one of my bitterly honest, brutally factual opinion of TikTok. Instagram and Facebook is still fine. And I highly recommend Telegram for technical groups especially if you're on CS. Telegram helps alot with my study and my shitposting needs. To make it brief,

> Use the curriculum as your guideline, not as something you follow blindly.

Yes, I mean it.

## Conclusion

Yeah, this is the end of this post. There's a couple stuff to recap from and I will gratefully retell you exactly that, but simplified.

1. Focus to even the tiniest detail possible but don't forget your surroundings.
2. Follow the etiquettes of asking in the internet mentioned before (also applies to real world).
3. Make a friend circle or more. That would help you greatly.
4. Befriend your lecturer or at least don't make them hate you.
5. Unite your peers. Don't treat them as your enemy for god's sake.
6. Don't blindly follow your curriculum. Use it as a guideline to not make your learning path a complete disarray.
7. Last but not least, don't be a dick.

Yeah that's all. And I hope you get some things or two after reading. See you next time and thanks for reading my article on how to be a proper college student 101 online/hybrid learning edition.
