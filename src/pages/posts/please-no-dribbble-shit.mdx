## A bit of an introduction, I guess

Do you know Dribbble? Yeah, surely that's an awesome website. Everything you can think of happening in the design space, most often, if exists, is just there in Dribbble. You have all sorts of nightmarish amalgamation of human ego sprawled upon that website - not saying that it's all garbage there, tho, it's really an awesome website for inspiration and some couple things I have no brain cells left to say currently in this writing.

Recently, I have caught both amazed and terrified at how UI/UX designers, especially in mobile and web development space since I'm into those kind of stuffs, design things so beautiful UI-wise, but at the same time, unnervingly _horrible_ and _unpractical_ UX-wise and DX-wise. Guess where that happens? That's right, Dribbble. In Dribbble, beautiful designs are a key to gain clout and shit. So much so, that people literally forget what UI/UX means. There are couple who understands their job there but most I see is, kid you not, something an edgy kid would create and think _"yeah, people would adore this shit when it got applied"_.

Let's dive into it, shall we? Don't worry, it's just a 5-minute trip.

## Okay, so, question

Before asking some stuff, let's jump into a bit basic technical knowledge that is more basic than the knowledge itself. Take a quick look at what UI/UX stands for. UI and UX in which UI is _User_ Interface and UX is _User_ Experience. Emphasize on the word _User_ there. The entire purpose of that term itself is centered around the _User_, it _is_ what the _User_ will _look_ and _experience_.

You, as a designer, has the responsibility to design according to the user's perspective and usage. In order to do that, there is a _thought process_. Who am I making this for? Why am I making this? How will the user use this? Which and what flow the user will expect and want to follow? Is my design usable? Is it practical? Is it overdone? Is it consistent? - The whole shebang.

This gets a bit fussy when I see Dribbble designs cause I don't know and can't see or even grasp into what the actual _fuck_ is going on with this or that design. Like literally, how many _different interfaces_ would you want to use to fucking deal with a landing page of a mobile app? Oh, and it has different interfaces for the menu, too! And seriously, why is the menu text fucking _vertical_ and arranged in a way that triggers someone's OCD to the point of no return. Also, what is the point of those sprites? Like, okay, the DNA strand one is fair but what about the others? Honestly, stop.

## Usability and practicality issues

I'm not saying that you can't make a design that is beautiful and at the same time, usable and practical. You can. But you have to think about the user's perspective and usage. You have to think about the flow of the user. You have to think about the consistency of the design. You have to think about the practicality of the design. You have to think about the usability of the design. You have to think about the accessibility of the design. You have to think about the _User_.

All that whatevermorphism shit **do not** take any account into that. They are made to _look beautiful_, not _usable_. In real world applications, kid you not, you need to include literally every single fucking type of person available including those with impaired visions, stroke, even a fucking comatose person is on that evergrowing list.

For example, tell me what text is in those glassy circular thing and what is the purpose of it being there?

<img className="w-full h-auto" alt="dribbble-3" src="/others/dribbble-3.webp" />

And tell me, where is the word "fridge" in this shit? without needing it to be highlighted or something.

<img className="w-full h-auto" alt="dribbble-4" src="/others/dribbble-4.webp" />

## Oh, the avarice of the human ego

I don't know what to say either. It's pretty mindblowing on how such thing can happen. It feels like more and more people there craves for their ego. Like, sure, you'll get your likes and views and recognition and shit but does it really has an impact to the user you're targetting?

Remember, UI/UX designs are meant for _user_ to consume, not your ego. If you're making a UI/UX design for your ego, then you're doing it wrong. You're doing it for the wrong reason. You're doing it for the wrong purpose. You're doing it for the wrong thing.

## Conclusion

Yeah, so that's a bit of my point of view and opinions. All I can say is we need better, more professional, realistically minded UI/UX designers. We need more people who understands the purpose of UI/UX design. We need more people who understands the purpose of UI/UX design in the real world. **We need more people who understands the purpose of UI/UX design in the real world and not just for the sake of their ego**.

I hope that sums it all, I guess. To the bed, I go!
