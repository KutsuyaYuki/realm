# The Problem

I know I'm a bit of a cool headed guy when it comes down to politically bound decisions made by one of governmental instances. After all, I'm an Indonesian, weird shit happens frequently in Indonesia. But this is just borderline retarded and fucking autistic at best. I mean, why the actual fuck do you want to actually ban all the good stuffs, Kominfo? Who the fuck has an idea to make this happen? You want to force your authority and control over Indonesian internet space, don't you? Then do it properly for fuck's sake. I cringed so hard hearing news about Steam and Epic Games (also PayPal) getting blocked for real. Like bitch what if there's an overseas client and they don't fucking know how to use a fucking debit card, let alone your cringe decisions to block it. "We can make better services" my ass. It took years of development, refining, and alot of fucking dudes and goods to at least make what we create decent enough to challenge those we already banned. To make stuffs worse, GitHub is on your target list. Oh wait, not only GitHub but the ENTIRE FUCKING SOURCE VERSION CONTROL websites. How are you supposed to make a swiss knife with only stick and stone and no safe place to save your progress like what the actual fuck, Kominfo?

Fuck you. Just, fuck you.

P.S. all of your websites are broken as hell. And I actually mean it. At least pay your devs proper salary.

# Verdict

Just stop, really. And fuck you if you're taking this personally.
