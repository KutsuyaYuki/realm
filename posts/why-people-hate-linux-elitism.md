# Abstract

You may not be aware of it but there is a certain level of elitism that exists among the users and developers of Linux. This attitude is prevalent among those who use and develop software specifically for the Linux operating system.

These elitist attitudes are mostly found in discussions relating to software development and usage of Linux. These attitudes are visible even on websites like Reddit where there are multiple threads dedicated to this topic. In this article, we will explore why people hate elitism as well as its implications for the future of Linux as an operating system.

# What is it anyways?

Linux elitism is the attitude that Linux is inherently superior to other operating systems. This is something that most people in the software development community are guilty of. Linux elitism is driven by the ideology that open source software is inherently more secure, robust, scalable, and cost effective than proprietary software. It is common for Linux users and developers to shun non-Linux users with this argument. Linux elitism manifests itself in multiple forms. First, it's the superiority complex that many Linux users display towards Mac and Windows users. Second, it's the superiority complex that many Linux developers display towards Mac and Windows developers. And third, it's the superiority complex that many open source advocates display towards users of proprietary software.

# Why people hate it so much?

There are several reasons behind why people generally dislike elitism. Let’s look at some of them. - No one likes to be ridiculed. People who use non-Linux operating systems may feel belittled by Linux users who treat their OS of choice as a superior one. Likewise, Mac and Windows users will also feel uncomfortable with the disparaging remarks made by Linux developers. - A certain level of elitism is common in the software development community. We have all seen the ‘software engineer’ vs ‘software developer’ debate. This is a classic example of elitism. - People who heavily rely on proprietary software for their day to day tasks will feel extremely uncomfortable with the comments made by open source advocates.

# Is it justified?

There is no doubt that open source software is more secure, robust, and cost effective in the long run than proprietary software. However, one cannot generalize a statement like this based on the user base of a single operating system. You cannot claim that something is better because only a select few are using it. There is no reason to belittle the millions of people using proprietary software. Linux may be the best operating system when compared to others in the context of open source software being used. However, it is highly unlikely that it will ever be able to compete with Mac and Windows when it comes to proprietary software. Most of the people will never be able to use open source software on their daily basis.

# "Use what works"

This statement has been coined for like millenia by many pragmatic minded people. It is the one true reason people can go forward with confidence and reason. Having a tried and tested battle hardened stuff is better than meddling with something unknown for the long term. In example, a reliable car is better than a car that goes fast but breaks every hour just because you try to optimize every bits of it. There's also a saying that,

> premature optimization is root of all evil.

And yes, it will be right. Because no one in their right mind wants that 0.0002 ms improvements over highly functional everyday things already baked for them, ready to use. It's not the matter of if it's super fast or super safe or whatnot, it's about the practicality. People tend to use things other people use quite significantly and has high following base to begin with. Not only it guarantees you better experience than said, something FLOSS but simply not-that-practical to use.

Also, FLOSS enthusiasts can be a bit irritating when it comes to discussing freedom. I mean, what's freedom anyways when you people forces other people to use what YOU want instead of what THEY actually want. It's very infuriating to see newbies get slammed hard by using what they generally prefer. It's their choice to do so. Freedom of choice, anybody?

# Conclusion

Linux elitism is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. The success of an operating system depends on the user base as well as the developer community. No one will feel motivated to use an operating system if they are constantly made to feel belittled. The only way to prevent elitism from ruining Linux is to sensitize the user base and the developer community regarding the implications of elitism. There is nothing wrong in being proud of the operating system that you use and the software that you create for it. At the same time, it is important to remember not to cross the line between self-pride and elitism.
