## Abstract

When you’re young, it’s easy to feel like there are only two options when it comes to facing your problems: You can either be strong or be weak. Either suck it up and move on, or wallow in self-pity and let the darkness overtake you. That’s not necessarily a bad way of thinking about things—there is such a thing as strength and weakness, after all. But the thing is, somewhere along the way we forget that life is actually more complicated than that. There are so many different shades in between those two extremes—so many ways to tackle your problems from a third, fourth, fifth… you get the point. In other words: Neither being strong nor being weak is the solution to every problem in your life. Instead, there are various coping mechanisms that might help you deal with whatever challenges you’re facing at any given time. So if you find yourself constantly teetering on either side of this spectrum because you don’t know where else to go from here — don’t worry; I gotcha!

## Don't stigmatize being strong or being weak

> “Only courageous hearts can endure the bitterness of truth.”

Yeah, I've had heard so many motivational quotes like this being coined. Being strong is a great thing — don’t get me wrong. But oftentimes, I make the mistake of idealizing this quality and assuming that it’s necessary for everyone. And we all know that’s not true. As I mentioned before, everyone is unique, and that applies to how I deal with problems in our lives. While certain people might be more comfortable bottling up their feelings and powering through whatever’s bothering them, others might be more likely to let their emotions consume them. You can’t judge people for being one way or the other — it’s all a part of being human. And sort to speak, I pretty much liked this quote more:

> “No one wants to believe they are weak, but we all have weakness inside us. We have strength, too, but there are times when the circumstances in our lives are so overwhelming that we easily succumb to that weakness.”

## Let go of your expectations

> “Live your life, sing your song. Not full of expectations. Not for the ovations. But for the joy of it.”

We all have certain expectations for ourselves. We have expectations of how we should be and what we should be doing with our lives. We have expectations of how other people should be treating us. We have expectations of how our partners and loved ones should be handling their problems. Sometimes, these expectations might come from a good place — you want to be the best version of yourself that you can be, for example. But in other cases, expect nothing and you might just surprise yourself. And when we say expectations, we don’t mean just your own. You might also have certain judgmental thoughts about the people in your life. You might be criticizing your partner for how they’re dealing with their stress, or you might be judging them for the way they’re handling the relationship.

## Identify what's making you feel bad and change it

A lot of people skip out on the “identify what’s making you feel bad” part of problem solving and go straight to the part where they start trying to change things. This is problematic because it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to find a solution to your problems if you don’t even know what they are.

The world is not a safe or pleasant place. It can be challenging to navigate life when the things that used to make you happy no longer do or the things that used to bring you joy no longer mean anything. This is especially true at times like during puberty, when so many changes come rushing in all at once. Because of this, it’s important to know what’s making you feel bad and how you can change it. Here are some of the most common things that are making us feel bad, what causes them, and how we can change them:

### You have a toxic friend relationship

The first thing to know is that some of your feelings about friends are about you. You might feel bad because you’re jealous of their good relationships or you might have some insecurity because you think they have things that you don’t. Sometimes, we feel bad because we don’t know how to be friends with people. If you’ve noticed that some of your friends are making you feel bad, take a moment to reflect on why that is. You might be able to figure out a way to approach it differently. As you figure out what your feelings mean, you might also want to consider if you’re treating your friends badly too. Sometimes, we treat others badly because we feel bad about ourselves. If you can figure this out, you might be able to change how you feel and how you treat your friends.

#### The "world is bad" mindset

If the world is bad for you, it might be time to re-evaluate your values. Often, people feel bad about the way the world is because they have a specific value that the world is missing. If you’re feeling bad about the world because it’s not the way you think it should be, try to figure out what your values are and whether or not the world is missing them. It’s possible that the world has other values that make it a better place. If you’re not sure what you want in the world or how to get it, you might want to look into other ways of contributing to society. Part of feeling bad is that you’re not sure what you want to do with your life and what you can do with your time.

### Thinking that you being treated badly is wrong

The second thing to know is that some of your feelings about people are about you. You might feel bad because you think that people don’t like you or you might have some insecurity about what people think about you. This is a common one for people who are trying to change as well as those who don’t have time to change. If you’re feeling bad about other people treating you badly, try to figure out what is scaring you about it. Often, what people are doing is confusing you with somebody else. You might be upset because you think you’re the same person that they’re treating badly. If this is the case, you can try to work out what you really think about yourself. You can also ask yourself if people really do like you. If they do, you might be able to take this a step further and ask yourself why it scares you so much.

### Nostalgia

The third thing to know is that some of your feelings about work or school come from you. You might feel bad because you’re not enjoying the work or you might be worried that you’re not good at it. This is another one where it’s important to figure out what’s scaring you and why you might feel bad. Often, it’s just a feeling of pressure. Work can be scary because, with it comes the pressure to make it in a way that you don’t necessarily want to be. You can try to figure out what would bring you happiness with this work but without the pressure. You can also ask yourself if you enjoy the work that you’re doing. There’s nothing wrong with that and if you enjoy it, you can ask if you can find a way to do it that brings you joy without the pressure.

### Literally not knowing what to do

The last thing to know is that some of your feelings about time come from you and some come from the world. You might feel bad because you don’t know what to do with your time or you might feel like you’re running out of time and have to skip over things that used to matter to you. Some people feel bad about the fact that they don’t have enough time with their loved ones and with their goals. If you don’t know what to do with your time and you’re feeling bad about it, you can try to figure out what you want to do with your free time. You can also try to figure out what you should be doing with your time. You can also try to figure out if you need to be doing something else with your time. There are always other things that you can do with your time that don’t take away from your goals.

## Get help from the people around you (and know when to ask for more)

We all want to be the heroes of our own stories. We want to be the ones who solve our own problems and change our lives for the better. We want to be the ones who rise above our challenges, slay our dragons, and emerge victorious. But the thing is, you can’t be all of those things by yourself. No single person can handle everything on their own — not even the strongest individual on the planet. And that’s perfectly fine! We want you to know that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It’s not a sign that you’re failing at life. It’s a sign that you’re human. And remember: Sometimes asking for help means more than just talking to a friend or loved one. Sometimes it means seeking professional help. That’s not a sign of weakness, either. It’s just a sign that you want to be able to tackle your problems from more angles and get better results.

## Take some me time and self appreciation

I’ve talked about how you shouldn’t expect nothing from yourself and how it’s okay to ask for help sometimes. But sometimes, you just need to step away from everything. Sometimes, you just need to take time for yourself. You can’t solve all your problems in one day. You can’t solve all your problems in one week. You can’t solve all your problems in one month. Sometimes, you just have to take a step back and let the stress of everything else in your life settle down so that it doesn’t overwhelm you. There’s no shame in needing time to yourself. In fact, it can be a really healthy thing to do.

## Conclusion

We all go through tough times in our lives, and some feelings that we experience during these times may seem to be too big to handle. These feelings, however, can be easily changed with the help of the right people. Friends are important to have in your life, and they can make a big difference in your life. You should try to make friends who are nice to you and who accept you as you are. It is important to maintain a good relationship with your friends. This means that you should not talk badly about your friends or talk badly about people in general. You should also try to go out with your friends whenever possible. In addition to maintaining a good relationship with your friends, it is also important to maintain a good relationship with yourself. You should try to make time for yourself so that you can relax and enjoy yourself. You should also try to make time for fun activities that you enjoy doing. When you are feeling bad about something, it is important to remember that some of these feelings are probably coming from within yourself. This means that you should not try to change the world or try to change what other people do. Instead, you should try to make small changes to how you act and how you treat other people.

> "Change is painful. But change is inevitable."

I know that solving problems can feel like a daunting task sometimes, especially when you’re feeling low or like you’re not getting anywhere with your struggles. But the thing is, problems weren’t created to be impossible to overcome. They were created so that we could learn from them and become better people for it. Yes, it can be hard to see past the struggles you’re going through right now, but try to keep that in mind — because I promise that things will get better if you keep at them. And remember: There are many ways to solve your problems, and you can use all of them at once.
