## Abstract

So, most of the times, I'm happy with the current framework my blog is using. It's kind of a burden to change to a new one if the old one is good enough. That's usually my spirit when it comes to online blogging. A bit niche but well, it works. Until, yeah you guess it, a shiny new framework come and ruin my perception on everything. So let's just get it straight. Here's a couple of reasons on why I change my blog frameworks in lightning speed whenever something new and shiny comes out.

## Shiny things looks shiny

> Oh yeah, sure, throw me your reasoning.

Have you ever seen this web framework?

![Fresh](/others/bfw-1.webp)

or this framework

![Qwik](/others/bfw-2.webp)

Okay, now here's one thing in common with both. They have shiny ~unrelated kinks~ **new features** available right out the box. First off, TypeScript is a first class citizen there. That means fully typed framework and that only means one thing: **subtle code autocompletion**.

Okay, let's discuss another shiny stuffs. Those frameworks have concepts on their own, with fresh embracing the island architecture and Qwik with their resumability. Each offered a new way for me to discover and learn from web development perspective. I tend to "yeah this is cool, I'll try it" over them and learn along the way.

## I'm bored, literally

> This one seems kind of reasonable.

Yeah, using the same thing over and over again for long period of time is kind of boring, to say the least. I'm someone who wants to break the flow whenever there's a chance. Changing courses is a no brainer for me. I like to try out new things and implement it in production (side projects only) just to know what results I can achieve and **kill this disease I have called boredom**.

Every people has their own ways of killing boredom but this is what I use to do it. It's kind of fun to me to watch and participate in changes on new web technologies or programming and coding development and evolution. It sparks the disignited curiosity deep inside me.

## I'm out of anime to watch

> Wait, what? What the actual f\*\*\* are you saying?

Uh, huh. Anime is a factor here. I'm not going to discuss much of it but yeah, anime plays an important role to whether I will change my blog's web framework or not. Simply put, if there's no interesting new anime or a suggested anime that I can watch, odds are I get bored. The more I get bored, the higher the chance I will lurk on Google to find new web technologies and subsequently, a shiny new ~probably unfit for production~ JavaScript or web framework.

## I have too much free time

> What? Isn't this a bliss instead? Don't you like it?

Don't get me wrong. I like it when I have so much time to spare. But there are cases where I have too much of it to spare I have risks of being counterproductive and lazy. Procrastinating isn't a new thing for me. But too much procrastination, I'll leave everything important and laziness controls my mind. That's a big no and a huge antipattern. As a developer, I need to learn and discover more things during this free time to further upgrade my knowledge and increase my skills.

## Inactivity on Telegram for long period of time

> Really? Telegram?

You might find this one as ridiculous if not more ridiculous than the first 3 reasons but yeah, it do be like that all the time. Telegram is the second main source of my killing boredom list. Since this is internet, I like throwing off some joke and trolling some people in Telegram just for the fun of it. Of course I pick where I do it. But nevertheless, if this one particular reason is on the list, then I would probably throw the feat.

Here's one example on why I like Telegram group chats so much:

![ender is a bulgarian](/others/bfw-3.webp)

If you don't know what Telegram is yet then go search it in Google or [insert whatever search engine you use]. Yeah, pardon me for the bad image(s). This is not a serious post at all with all due respect.

## Why not?

> But why?

And lastly, _why not?_ I'm not losing anything aside from some couple hundred MBs of storage thanks to the `node_modules` file piling up in my project directory.

## Epilogue

Yeah, you've reached the end of this post. Thank you for wasting your time to read this post I've made. And thank you for coming to this blog. Anyways, have a nice time and don't forget to stay productive!
