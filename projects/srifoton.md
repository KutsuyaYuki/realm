# Description

So I volunteered in this project as one of the front end devs. This site uses React and has following features implemented (incl. back end):

- Authentication with JWT Web Token.
- An invoice system.
- A forget password mechanism.
- Email verification.

Unfortunately, there are some quirks here and there such as:

- No admin page for managing accounts and payments. (everything is done by the back end team through server's SSH)
- An okay-ish design with some stuffs kinda off.
- Form validation works when you click submit once. (it simply won't run before)
- The footer is not responsive enough.

Here's the link to the back end part: [srifoton-be](https://github.com/HMIF-UNSRI/srifoton-be).
