## Description

Made with the newest, edgiest framework currently. This blog shall be the first project I list. It is just a regular blog with few stuffs missing which I am still trying to bring back.

Features include:

- A layout following Material You with slight modifications.
- Using Markdown files for content.
- Less JavaScript sent to browser.
- A nice footer I got from literally the fresh.deno.dev header. (Shoutout to them for creating that awesome water drop and waves animations)
- Progressive Web App implemented.
- Full `twind` integration.
- Using `ky` as fetch utility for better DX.
- No build step. (It deploys instantly thanks to fresh framework)
- Fast. Really fast.
- Strict TypeScript type definitions.
- No test cases cause why do you even want it in a blog?

Features that may/may not be implemented in the future:

- Comment system.
- Contact Me page.
- Theme Switcher. (The blog itself actually has 2 themes)
- Test cases. (Yeah, I actually need it)
- A search bar for both posts and projects.
- Switch to FAB-based navigation.
- Code refactoring.
