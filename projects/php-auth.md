# Description

This is the midterm assignment for my (well, our) Web Programming pt.2 course in my university.

This website has following features implemented:

- Robust authentication with strict validation rules and filtering.
- A near CRUD implementation. (I forgot to do the delete account part)
- Using MySQL to store user credentials.
- Using PDO to interact with MySQL.
- Hardened security patched to avoid XSS and CSRF.
- Using sessions and manipulating its usage as a madman.
