# My Website

Basically my website. Nothing so special about it.

## Using as Template

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/realm
```

2. Modify template using your beloved text-editor.

   > Clue: Everything is in the `components` folder. Not everything tho.

3. Start blogging. (Don't forget to delete all my contents)

Run `npm run dev` to preview the site.
