## Kitsune Mask latest debug build workaround for Termux

In general, latest debug builds of Kitsune Mask changed the mounting
location of `su` binary from `/system/bin` to `/apex/com.android.runtime/bin`
to reduce bind mount. This is a good thing, but it breaks Termux's hardcoded
`su` path.

This is not a permanent solution and is merely a dumb way of some sorts
to make commands at least work in Termux.

```bash
alias su="/debug_ramdisk/su"
alias sudo="/debug_ramdisk/su -c"
```

Yes, it's that dumb. But it works.
